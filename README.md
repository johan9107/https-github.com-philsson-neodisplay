# neodisplay
NodeMCU based neopixel display. I am using a 8x36, 256 pixel display when developing this project. The display will eventually show time, do animations, games etc.

## NodeMCU
The display is driven by a NodeMCU connected to your WiFi. Primarelly the display will receive updates through UDP. By itself it will have some features as for example showing the time.

## Python
It is here the display really comes to life. Here we implement the big features. My initial plan is to implement rolling text, snake and Tetris.
